## Welcome to the PWA Studio VSCode Extension

The PWA Studio Code Extension brings commands and interface to VSCode that are specific to developing progressive web applications, turning your go-to developer environment into a PWA workshop. The extension includes functionality for:

* Starting a new PWA
* Converting an existing web app into a PWA
* Managing your PWA's manifest and service workers
* Packaging your PWA for the Microsoft, Google, and Apple Stores
* **...and more!**

[Our documentation](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-vscode/wiki) contains all the info you need for working with the extension, including tutorials and more!
